# Invoices, a simple invoice generator

Invoices generates clean and lightweight invoices fast, in batches, right on your computer.

While I could do all this with external apps, I've chosen to pick tools that give me full control of my data and to do everything right in my text editor when it comes to accounting. I only needed one external tool to manage invoices and generate them, e.g. following a crowdfunding campaign. This is **Invoices**.

## The tool

Invoices generates one HTML and one PDF invoice for each entry in a CSV file.

## Export format

Invoices exports files to dist/{csv-file-name}/YYYY-MM-DD-0001-client-name.pdf
